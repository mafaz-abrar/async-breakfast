# Async-Breakfast
Using C#, I created a simple application that uses events and asynchronous programming patterns to simulate a kitchen preparing breakfast. I used this application to learn and practise usage of events, delegates and asynchronous programming in C#.

A Kitchen class has the asynchronous method MakeBreakfast. This method calls three more methods, FryEggsAsync, ToastBreadAsync and MakeTeaAsync. Each of these methods works the exact same way.
